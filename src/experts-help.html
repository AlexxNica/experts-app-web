        </ul>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>One of the primary purposes of this version of the application is to create a better understanding between a activity an expert enters and the interactions and actions that occur around that activity.</p>

        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Activity Record contains one or more Activity Links</li>
          <li>Activity Links determine impact</li>
          <li>Activity Link type can have different types of impact</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <li>Direct Impact: Face to Face contact</li>
          <li>Indirect Impact: Social sharing, certain online activity</li>
          <li>Trained Impact: Lesson based, face to face or remote</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="activityrecords">Understanding Activity Records</h2>
        <p>An activity record is the top level thing that you have done. You can think of it as any number of things:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A talk or speaking engagement</li>
          <li>An article or blog post</li>
          <li>Organizating an event</li>
          <li>Helping at a codelab</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are simply too many types of activity a Google Expert may partake, but the key thing to remember is that this is the top level thing you have done. We consider this activity the master record.</p>

        <p>Taken at face value, the entry of an activity has no measurable impact score. Instead, we ask that you add at least one activity link to track impact.</p>

        <h2 id="activitylinks">Understanding Activity Links and Impact</h2>
        <p>One of the primary problems that the old system faced was the nature of the supporting actions that took place around activities. Consider:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A talk: you tweeted, you have slides, you have sample code, et cetera</li>
          <li>An article or blog post: you tweeted, the publication tweeted, you have the article link, et cetera </li>
          <li>Organizating an event: you have an event link, you have tweets, you code, you have lots of material, et cetera</li>
          <li>Helping at a codelab: you have the event link, you have a tweet, you have organizer outreach, et cetera</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All those supporting actions were often hard to track, resulting in experts creating lots of primary activities when many should have simply rolled up into one master record.</p>

        <p>In this version of the system, you can add as many Activity Links you want to a master record on the Edit screen, allowing you to have many types of measurables on a given activity making it easier to track how much goes on around the hard work you put in.</p>

        <h2 id="impact">Understanding Impact</h2>
        <p>One of the major changes is the way impact is measured on an activity. Three things to remember:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Activity Records contain Activity Links</li>
          <li>Activity Links determine impact</li>
          <li>Activity Link type can have different types of impact</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If the activity link type can have different impact, what are the types of impact we are now tracking?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Direct Impact: Face to Face contact</li>
          <li>Indirect Impact: Social sharing, certain online activity</li>
          <li>Trained Impact: Lesson based, face to face or remote</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In most cases, you don't have to worry about what type of impact a particular link will require. Let's look at a few examples:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Meetup Link: Direct Impact (people came to the event)</li>
          <li>Tweet: Indirect Impact</li>
          <li>Codelab: Trained (people came to the event)</li>
          <li>Online Course: Trained Impact (people came to the course and completed)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Don't see a link type that works? You can always use <i>Generic URL</i>, which gives you all the impact stats (you can choose the most relevent).</p>

        <h2 id="examples">Activity Examples</h2>
        <p>The following are examples of common activity/activity link relationships.</p>

        <h3>A Talk or Speaking Engagement</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Master Activity Record: My Talk - Magical Words
          <ol>
            <li>Activity link: My Talk @ Org Website</li>
            <li>Activity link: Tweet about event</li>
            <li>Activity link: Slides</li>
            <li>Activity link: Github Repo Code sample</li>
            <li>Activity link: Tweet after event target slides+code</li>
            <li>Activity link: Tweet about event by Org</li>
            <li>Activity link: Tweet about event by you Product Team</li>
            <li>Activity link: Article about your talk @ Third Party Publication</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Community Work</h3>
        <p>Sometimes it can be hard capturing the smaller things that go into helping the community you serve. Consider keeping tabs like so:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Master Activity Record: Monthly Community Support
          <ol>
            <li>Activity link: My Stack Overflow links</li>
            <li>Activity link: Forum post on bug issue</li>
            <li>Activity link: Ticket and test case filed for issue</li>
            <li>Activity link: Github answers and ticket responses</li>
            <li>Activity link: PR code reviews</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>Have a question you'd like answered? Send us a question and let us know!</p>

        <h3>What happened to all my previous activities?</h3>
        <p>Your old tracking data is safe. We have not yet ported the old data format into the new format. It is planned for a future version.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>What happened to the automatic importing from Google+ and Stack Overflow?</h3>
        <p>In an attempt to handle a more wide range of activity, we have disabled this functionailty in this version.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>What if my activity doesn't have a link? How do I track impact?</h3>
        <p>We've found that this is usually an edge case, typically involving certain types of mentoring (where one-on-one private meetings can occur). We ask that you use Generic URL with the best-case link you can think of for the time being.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Why doesn't the activity link screen parse the url and pull the proper metrics?</h3>
        <p>This requirement is planned for a future version.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Where can I file bugs or help add functionality?</h3>
        <p>You can file tickets and help work on this app in the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleDeveloperExperts/experts-app-web">GoogleDeveloperExperts/experts-app-web</a> repo on Github.</p>
